                <p>This summer, I went back to China to spend time with my family and hang out with my friends.
                    I visited Beijing for the first time to see some of my friends and explore the city. My favorite 
                    food there was Beijing Duck (shown in the first image). The duck was roasted to perfectionâ€”crispy on 
                    the outside and tender on the inside. I also tried Beijing pastries for the first time. These pastries 
                    came in various shapes and had distinct appearances. Their flavors varied as well, including rose and red bean.
                </p>
                <p>The places that impressed me the most were Shi Cha Hai and Drum Tower. Standing on the top floor of the Drum Tower, I could see
                    the beatiful view of ancient Chinese buildings and the Shi Cha Hai lake. The lake was lively, with many people boating on its calm waters.
                     The last image was me striking a pose in front of the Drum Tower. I truly love Beijing because it is such a unique city, rich with history and stories rooted in 
                these old architecture.</p>

                    <p>After my trip to Beijing, I returned to my hometown, Shanghai,  where I had the chance to 
                        reconnect with friends and explore new experiences.</p>
                    <p>One highlight of my time there was visiting the Gentle Monster Exhibition with my friend Ivy.
                        This exhibition was created not only to showcase new products, but also to celebrate 
                        art and fashion through its innovative decorations.
                        We were both impressed by the authentic giant face sculpture (shown on the left image).</p>
                    <p>As we wandered through the exhibit, Ivy and I also had fun trying on various kinds of eyeglasses (shown in the right image)
                        It was an unforgettable experience for us to appreciate fashion and art.
